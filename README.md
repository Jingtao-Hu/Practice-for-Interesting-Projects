# Practice-for-Interesting-Projects
This respository records my machine learning practice of intereting projects that I found in the Internet. I will mainly repeat those projects for boosting my machine learning knowledge and skills. Just have fun!

**1.[Alphabet Recognition Through Gestures]** - An interesting practice for OpenCV and Keras, building a script for Alphabet Recognition Through Gestures. Reading and doing these code carefully, we can acquire more experience. You can also find the original code from [akshaychandra21](https://github.com/akshaychandra21/Alphabet_Recognition_Gestures#execution), and a [tutorial article](https://towardsdatascience.com/tutorial-alphabet-recognition-deeplearning-opencv-97e697b8fb86). 

**2.[Linear Filter]** - An interesting practice for OpenCV and Keras, building a script for understanding linear filters by CNN. In this project, a simple single layer convolutional neural network is trained to perform linear filtering using natural image data. You can also find the original code from [vexcel](https://github.com/vexcel/Keras-LearnLinearFilter), and a [tutorial article](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-to-perform-linear-filtering-using-natural-image-data-db289d0b0457).
