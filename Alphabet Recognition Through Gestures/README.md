You can directly execute the python script[alphabet_recognition.py](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Practice-for-Interesting-Projects/blob/master/Alphabet%20Recognition%20Through%20Gestures/alphabet_recognition.py) or the [jupyter notebook]() which I commented detail. This project just uses letters and I think we can modify code easily for using it for other symbols such as digits.
